# The Problem

Write a recursive function Frec(n) that computes Fibonacci numbers. Then write an iterative version of Fibonacci number function Fit(n). Functions Frec(n) and Fit(n) return the same value but with different performance.

Write the main program that discovers the value N10 so that Frec(N10) runs on your machine close to 10 seconds. Then measure the run time of Fit(N10) and compute how many times is Fit(N10) faster than Frec(N10). Show what is N10 on your machine.



# Implementation

I used two very standard methods for calculating the fibonacci sequence and felt no need to deviate from these methods. In my source code I call the method fibTimeMeasurement() to calculate how long either method takes to run the fibonacci(n) sequence.

At first I was using regular signed integers to hold the values and realized how futile it was after calling fibonacci(20). For the return values of the methods I switched to unsigned long long and that greatly increased the precision.

Looking at my execution, it is clear that I was not able to land directly on 10 seconds, but I feel that n=46 for my program will suffice for N10 for my machine. Fit() is about 3145078 times faster than Frec(), but this is hardly surprising when comparing a linear function, O(n), to an exponential function, O(1.618^n).
